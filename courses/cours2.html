        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 20px;color:#ef3830 ;"> # Protocols and Networking</h5>
        <p>It is essential for Cyber Security Professionals to have a solid understanding of how computers communicate. There is much more happening behind the scenes of computer networks than what can be observed when using applications.</p>
           
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 20px;color:#ef3830 ;"> # The OSI Model</h5>
        <p>The OSI ("Open Systems Interconnection") model represents an easy and intuitive way to standardize the different parts required to communicate across networks.</p>
        <p>The model makes it clear what is required to communicate on a network by splitting the requirements into multiple layers. </p>
        <p>This is what the OSI Model looks like:</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img style="margin-bottom: 50px; width: 100%;" src="/images/osi model.png" alt="">
        </div> 

        
        <p>The top 3 layers are typically implemented in software within the Operating System:</p>
        <div class="image">
            <img style="margin-bottom: 50px; width: 100%;" src="/images/Screenshot 2024-05-19 at 23.33.36.png" alt="">
        </div> 
        <p>The bottom 3 layers are typically implemented in hardware within devices on the network, e.g. Switches, Routers and Firewalls:</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img style="margin-bottom: 50px; width: 100%;" src="/images/Screenshot 2024-05-19 at 23.36.13.png" alt="">
        </div> 


        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 20px;color:#ef3830 ;"> # Layer 7 - Application Layer</h5>
        <p>The business logic and functionality of the application lies here. This is what the users use to interact with services across a network. Most developers create applications on the Application Layer.</p>
    
        <p>Most of the applications you use are on the Application Layer, with the complexity of the other layers hidden.</p>  
        <p>Examples of Layer 7 Applications:</p>
        <li>HTTP ("Hypertext Transfer Protocol") - Enables us to access web applications</li>
        <li>FTP ("File Transfer Protocol") - Allows users to transfer files</li>
        <li>SNMP ("Simple Network Management Protocol") - Protocol to read and update network device configurations</li>

        <p>There are many applications which uses these protocols like Google Chrome, Microsoft Skype and FileZilla.      </p>
        <p style="color:#ef3830;margin-bottom: 20px;" >You are accessing this class via Layer 7!</p>

        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 20px;color:#ef3830 ;"> # Layer 6 - Presentation Layer</h5>

        <p>Typically an unseen layer, but is responsible of adapting, transforming and translating data. This is to ensure the application and layers beneath can understand one another.    </p>
        <li>Encoding Schemes used to represent text and data, for example ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and UTF(Unicode Transformation Format).</li>

        <li>Encryption for services, for example SSL ("Secure Sockets Layer") and TLS ("Transport Security Layer")  </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Compression, for example GZip in use in many implementations of HTTP.</li>

        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 20px;color:#ef3830 ;"> # Layer 5 - Session Layer</h5>

        <p>  This layer's responsibility is handling connections between the application and the layers below. It involves establishing, maintaining and terminating connections, otherwise referred to as sessions.</p>

        <p> Common protocols which represent the Session Layer well are:  </p>

        <li>SOCKS - A protocol for sending packets through a proxy server.</li>

        <li>NetBIOS - An older Windows protocol for establishing sessions and resolving names. </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">SIP ("Session Initiation Protocol") - For engaging in VOIP ("Voice Over IP") communications  </li>

        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 20px;color:#ef3830 ;"> # Layer 4 - Transport</h5>
        <p>The layer which allows applications to be represented on the network.</p>

        <p> Some well known applications on this layer:</p>

        <li>TCP ("Transmission Control Protocol") - Used for many applications, ensuring stability, control of how much data can be sent at any given time, reliability and more.</li>
        <li>UDP ("User Datagram Protocol") - Lightweight and quick protocol use for many services.        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">QUIC ("Quick UDP Internet Connections") - A protocol designed for faster connections and goes hand-in-hand with the version 2 of the HTTP protocol.</li>

        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 20px;color:#ef3830 ;"> # Layer 3 - Network</h5>

        <p>A layer responsible of routing packets between networks via routers.     </p>
        <p>On this layer, the following protocols reside:     </p>
        <li>IP ("Internet Protocol") - Used everyday when accessing the Internet. Comes in two versions, IP version 4 and 6.
        </li>
        <li>ICMP ("Internet Control Message Protocol") - Used by network devices and network operators, to diagnose network connections or for devices to send and respond to error conditions and more.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">IPSec ("Internet Protocol Security") - Allows encrypted and secure connections between two network devices.
        </li>

        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 20px;color:#ef3830 ;"> # Layer 2 - Link</h5>
        <p>Link networks, as the name implies, consist of protocols designed to send packets through the actual links (physical connections) that network nodes are connected to. A simpler way of thinking of it is that the Link Layer is responsible for moving data from physical over to logical (to the network layer).</p>
        <p>Protocols on this layer include:</p>

        <li>Ethernet - An essential protocol used by most operating systems when connecting to networks using a physical cable.</li>
        <li>Wi-Fi ("Wireless Fidelity") - For accessing networks via radio signals. It uses a family of protocols called IEEE 802.11.xx</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">NDP ("Neighbor Discovery Protocol") - IP version 6(IPv6) uses this protocol on the Link Layer to gather information required to communicate via IPv6</li>

        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 20px;color:#ef3830 ;"> # Layer 1 - Physical</h5>

        <p>Physical layer represents the signaling which allows bits and bytes to transfer between a physical medium. It can be transferred via radio or signals over a cable, using electrical signals or light, for example fiber.</p>
        <p>Examples of the Physical Layer protocols includes:</p>
        <li>CAN Bus ("Controller Area Network") - Used in microcontrollers and other devices to communicate to other similar devices, not involving a computer. Often used in ICS ("Industrial Control Systems").</li>
        <li>Ethernet Physical Layer - Used by Ethernet on the physical layer to send signals with speeds up to many gigabits of traffic per second.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 200px;">Bluetooth Physical Layer - Bluetooth also has its own specifications on how radio signals should be sent and received.</li>
